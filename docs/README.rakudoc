=TITLE B<File::Copy> - Provides the essential functions of the POSIX C<cp> command

=SYNOPSIS 

=begin code
use File::Copy; # exports routine 'cp'
cp "/usr/share/fonts/", "/home/fonts"; # the trailing slash is not required
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Exported function C<cp> copies files and directories from one location to another.
Its behavior is intended to be very similar to the POSIX C<cp> utility program.

If the C<$from> location is a directory, it and all its top-level files will
copied to the C<$to> location. A fatal error will be
thrown if C<$from> is a directory and C<$to> is a file.
If the recursive option (C<:r>) is used, all below the C<from> path
will be copied.

Errors will also be thrown if the permissions in either location are
not appropriate for the selected operation.

Existing files B<will> be overwritten unless the C<:createonly> option
is selected.

Current named options:

=item C<:i> (or C<:interactive>) - Asks permission to overwrite an existing file.

=item C<:r> (or C<:recursive>) - When the source (C<$from>) is a directory, copy recursively.

=item C<:c> (or C<:createonly>) - Existing files will <not> be overwritten, but notice will be given.

=item C<:v> (or C<:verbose>) - Informs the user about copying details.

See an example Raku program using this module in the module package repository
at L<examples>.
